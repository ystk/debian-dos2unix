NAME
       unix2dos - UNIX to DOS/MAC text file format converter


SYNOPSYS
       unix2dos  [options] [-c convmode] [-o file ...] [-n infile outfile ...]

       Options:

       [-fhkLlqV]  [--force]  [--help]  [--keepdate]  [--license]  [--newline]
       [--quiet] [--version]


DESCRIPTION
       Unix2dos  converts text files in UNIX format to DOS/MAC format.  Binary
       files and non-regular files, such  as  soft  links,  are  automatically
       skipped, unless conversion is forced.

       Unix2dos   has  a  few  conversion  modes  similar  to  unix2dos  under
       SunOS/Solaris.

       In DOS/Windows text files line endings exist out of  a  combination  of
       two  characters:  a  Carriage Return (CR) followed by a Line Feed (LF).
       In Unix text files line endings exists out of a single Newline  charac-
       ter  which  is  equal  to  a DOS Line Feed (LF) character.  In Mac text
       files, prior to Mac OS X, line endings exist out of a  single  Carriage
       Return  character. Mac OS X is Unix based and has the same line endings
       as Unix.


OPTIONS
       The following options are available:


       -c --convmode convmode
              Set conversion mode. Where convmode is one of: ascii, 7bit, iso,
              mac with ascii being the default.


       -f --force
              Force conversion of all files. Also binary files.


       -h --help
              Display online help.


       -k --keepdate
              Keep the date stamp of output file same as input file.


       -L --license
              Display software license.


       -l --newline
              Add  additional  newline.  Only Unix line endings are changed to
              two DOS line endings.  In Mac mode Unix line endings are changed
              to two Mac line endings.


       -n --newfile infile outfile ...
              New  file  mode. Convert the infile and write output to outfile.
              File names must be given in pairs and wildcard names should  NOT
              be used or you WILL lose your files.


       -o --oldfile file ...
              Old file mode. Convert the file and write output to it. The pro-
              gram default to run in this mode. Wildcard names may be used.


       -q --quiet
              Quiet mode. Suppress all warning and messages.


       -V --version
              Display version information.


CONVERSION MODES
       Conversion modes ascii , 7bit  ,  and  iso  are  similar  to  those  of
       unix2dos under SunOS/Solaris.


       ascii  In  this  mode  Unix line endings are converted to DOS line end-
              ings.  DOS and Mac line endings are not changed.

              Although the name of this mode is ASCII, which is a 7 bit  stan-
              dard, the actual mode is 8 bit.


       mac    In  this  mode  Unix line endings are converted to Mac line end-
              ings.  DOS and Mac line endigs are not changed.


       7bit   In this mode Unix line endings are converted to  DOS  line  end-
              ings.   All  8 bit non-ASCII characters (with values from 128 to
              255) are converted to a space.


       iso    In this mode Unix line endings are converted to  DOS  line  end-
              ings.    Characters   are   converted  from  ISO  character  set
              ISO-8859-1 to DOS character set (code  page)  CP437.  ISO-8859-1
              characters without CP437 equivalent, for which conversion is not
              possible, are converted to a dot.  CP437 is mainly used  in  the
              USA. In Western Europe CP850 is more standard.

              Another option to convert text files between different encodings
              is to use unix2dos in combination with iconv(1). Iconv can  con-
              vert between a long list of character encodings. Some examples:

              Convert from Unix Latin-1 to DOS DOSLatinUS

              unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t CP437 > out.txt

              Convert from Unix Latin-1 to DOS DOSLatin1

              unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t CP850 > out.txt

              Convert from Unix Latin-1 to Windows WinLatin1

              unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t CP1252 > out.txt

              Convert from Unix UTF-8 (Unicode) to Windows WinLatin1

              unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f UTF-8 -t CP1252 in.txt > out.txt

              Convert from Unix UTF-8 (Unicode) to Windows UTF-16 (Unicode)

              unix2dos < in.txt | iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16 > out.txt

              and <http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html>.


UNICODE
       Unicode files can be encoded in different encodings. On Unix/Linux Uni-
       code files are mostly encoded in UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is ASCII compat-
       ible.  UTF-8 files can be in DOS, Unix or Mac format. It is safe to run
       dos2unix/unix2dos on UTF-8 encoded  files.  On  Windows  mostly  UTF-16
       encoding is used for Unicode files. Dos2unix/unix2dos should not be run
       on UTF-16 files. UTF-16 files are automatically skipped, because it are
       binary files.
