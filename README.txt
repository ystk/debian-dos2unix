dos2unix - DOS/MAC to UNIX text file format converter.

unix2dos - UNIX to DOS/MAC text file format converter.



This is an update of Benjamin Lin's implementations of dos2unix and unix2dos.
Benjamin Lin's implementations of dos2unix and unix2dos are part of several
Linux distributions such as RedHat, Fedora, Suse and others. This update
includes all RedHat patches and fixes several other problems.
Internationalization has been added and ports to DOS, Windows, Cygwin and OS/2
Warp have been made. 

These implementations of dos2unix and unix2dos were originally made as an Open
Source alternative for dos2unix/unix2dos under SunOS/Solaris. They have a few
similar conversion modes, namely ascii, 7bit and iso. The first versions were
made by John Birchfield in 1989, and in 1995 rewritten from scratch by Benjamin
Lin.
