NAME
       dos2unix - DOS/MAC to UNIX text file format converter


SYNOPSYS
       dos2unix  [options] [-c convmode] [-o file ...] [-n infile outfile ...]

       Options:

       [-fhkLlqV]  [--force]  [--help]  [--keepdate]  [--license]  [--newline]
       [--quiet] [--version]


DESCRIPTION
       Dos2unix  converts  plain  text files in DOS/MAC format to UNIX format.
       Binary files and non-regular files, such as soft links,  are  automati-
       cally skipped, unless conversion is forced.

       Dos2unix   has  a  few  conversion  modes  similar  to  dos2unix  under
       SunOS/Solaris.

       In DOS/Windows text files line endings exist out of  a  combination  of
       two  characters:  a  Carriage Return (CR) followed by a Line Feed (LF).
       In Unix text files line endings exists out of a single Newline  charac-
       ter  which  is  equal  to  a DOS Line Feed (LF) character.  In Mac text
       files, prior to Mac OS X, line endings exist out of a  single  Carriage
       Return  character. Mac OS X is Unix based and has the same line endings
       as Unix.


OPTIONS
       The following options are available:


       -c --convmode convmode
              Set conversion mode. Where convmode is one of: ascii, 7bit, iso,
              mac with ascii being the default.


       -f --force
              Force conversion of all files. Also binary files.


       -h --help
              Display online help.


       -k --keepdate
              Keep the date stamp of output file same as input file.


       -L --license
              Display software license.


       -l --newline
              Add  additional  newline.   Only DOS line endings are changed to
              two Unix line endings.  In Mac mode only Mac  line  endings  are
              changed to two Unix line endings.


       -n --newfile infile outfile ...
              New  file  mode. Convert the infile and write output to outfile.
              File names must be given in pairs and wildcard names should  NOT
              be used or you WILL lose your files.


       -o --oldfile file ...
              Old file mode. Convert the file and write output to it. The pro-
              gram default to run in this mode. Wildcard names may be used.


       -q --quiet
              Quiet mode. Suppress all warning and messages.


       -V --version
              Display version information.


CONVERSION MODES
       Conversion modes ascii , 7bit  ,  and  iso  are  similar  to  those  of
       dos2unix under SunOS/Solaris.


       ascii  In  this  mode  DOS line endings are converted to Unix line end-
              ings.  Unix and Mac line endings are not changed.

              Although the name of this mode is ASCII, which is a 7 bit  stan-
              dard, the actual mode is 8 bit.


       mac    In  this  mode  Mac line endings are converted to Unix line end-
              ings.  DOS and Unix line endigs are not changed.


       7bit   In this mode DOS line endings are converted to  Unix  line  end-
              ings.   All  8 bit non-ASCII characters (with values from 128 to
              255) are converted to a space.


       iso    In this mode DOS line endings are converted to  Unix  line  end-
              ings.   Characters  are  converted  from DOS character set (code
              page) CP437 to ISO character set  ISO-8859-1.  CP437  characters
              without  ISO-8859-1 equivalent, for which conversion is not pos-
              sible, are converted to a dot.  CP437 is mainly used in the USA.
              In Western Europe CP850 is more standard.

              Another option to convert text files between different encodings
              is to use dos2unix in combination with iconv(1). Iconv can  con-
              vert between a long list of character encodings. Some examples:

              Convert from DOS DOSLatinUS to Unix Latin-1

              iconv -f CP437 -t ISO-8859-1 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

              Convert from DOS DOSLatin1 to Unix Latin-1

              iconv -f CP850 -t ISO-8859-1 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

              Convert from Windows WinLatin1 to Unix Latin-1

              iconv -f CP1252 -t ISO-8859-1 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

              Convert from Windows WinLatin1 to Unix UTF-8 (Unicode)

              iconv -f CP1252 -t UTF-8 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

              Convert from Windows UTF-16 (Unicode) to Unix UTF-8 (Unicode)

              iconv -f UTF-16 -t UTF-8 in.txt | dos2unix > out.txt

              and <http://czyborra.com/charsets/iso8859.html>.


UNICODE
       Unicode files can be encoded in different encodings. On Unix/Linux Uni-
       code files are mostly encoded in UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is ASCII compat-
       ible.  UTF-8 files can be in DOS, Unix or Mac format. It is safe to run
       dos2unix/unix2dos on UTF-8 encoded  files.  On  Windows  mostly  UTF-16
       encoding is used for Unicode files. Dos2unix/unix2dos should not be run
       on UTF-16 files. UTF-16 files are automatically skipped, because it are
       binary files.
